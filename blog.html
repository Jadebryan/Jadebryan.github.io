                        <p>Computing encompasses the study and use of computers, software, and systems to process and manage information.
                        <p>The field of computing offers diverse career paths, including software development, data science, cybersecurity,network administration, and more.
                        <p>The information processing cycle involves input, processing, output, and storageof data.Input is recieved, processed by the computer,and results in output, with storage ensuring data persistance for future use. 
                        <p>Computer systems comprise hardware and software components working together.Hardware includes the physical components like the processor and memory, while software encompasses the programs that enable the computer to perform tasks.
                        <p>Computer security is vital to protect systems and data from unauthorized acces or damage. Concepts include encryption, firewalls, antivirus software, and user authentication to safeguard against cyber threats.
                        <p>HTML (Hypertex Markup Language) and CSS(Cascading Style Sheet) are fundamental web development languages. HTML structures content on the web, while CSS styles and formats it.</p>

                        <h2><i class='bx bxs-bookmark-heart' ></i>Favorite Lesson</h2>
                        <p>Among all the topics that has been discussed, my all time fave will be always BASIC HTML & CSS, because it really made me wonder how this and that works and I really love exploring things and trying new ways to fix what has to be fixed in my html. I already spent a lot of sleepless nights developing my website but I guess all of that was worth it. This made me wonder, what if I'll be just a Web Developer soon?
                        <p>I'm looking forward to learn more about HTML & CSS and also I'm trying to learn some basic JavaScripts. Doing all of these is  challenging yet so rewarding at the end and I love that. </p>
